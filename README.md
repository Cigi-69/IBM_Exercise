# IBM_Exercise

## Project overview

### Used technologies
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
I used these technologies, since they are required on the position which I aplied.

### Choosed solution
Based on the project desctription I choosed simplicity and clarity, threfore 
I present the data in table. So all required data are available on the screen.
All the main cattergories of the customers (Inactive, With negarive balance, regular) 
are color-differentiated - so they can be immediately distinguished.

There were also created simple filters for quick way to display only desired category of the customers.
In that case the total balance is automatically re-calculated for current (choosed) group.

### Future features
#### Data analysis and visualisation
For Jim (the salesman) will be helpful see some graph with data about customers age, gender, balance
and activity to see which customers are really perspective and to which of them he should take care of.

#### Analysis of customers behaviour on the company web page
For Jim it will be also helpful to see how the customers are behaviour on the company webpage.
Based on the data the web page can be reorganized or simplified - to make visitors to became 
a customers.
